layout: entry
---
## January 2024 - May 2024

## Overview
In this role, I worked alongside Professor Dezhi Wu at the University of South Carolina and 2 other students to design and implement a chatbot to assist in theraputic conversation for children with autism.

## Work to date
As of March 2024, this project is still a work in progress.

Our team conducted a literature review in January and February to determine the possibilities for this application. Through this, we determined that there is existing evidence that a chatbot could be implemented to assist in children with autism in improving communication and helping with social anxiety.

Our project aims to focus on the areas of fun, social skills training (SST), and helping with emotional regulation.

To accomplish this, we used Google's chatbot service DialogFlow to set up use cases in a professional manner. This software was chosen due to its inclusion in studies within the literature review, as well as offering a low-cost solution for this study.
