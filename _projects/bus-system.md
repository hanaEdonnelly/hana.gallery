## Project Overview
The USC bus transportation system faces challenges such as low utilization by riders, potentially impacting the optimal allocation of student tuition funds for transportation. Additionally, USC Transportation lacks existing research or data collection mechanisms aimed at understanding why students choose not to utilize the bus system, implying a deficiency in understanding potential users.

Due to the nature of USC Transportation busses being funded by student tuition funds, businesses need is demonstrated through current suboptimal transportation usage. This project aims to find ways to maximize student use and ensure efficiency. Our recommendation aims to demonstrate the need for continued USC bus funding, while also allowing the University to secure future funding for  AI-driven projects.
