In ITEC444, we were instructed to create a mobile app design for our course-long project.

I chose to re-design the "Cockpit" app, a proprietary app at USC for students and faculty to access free football tickets.

The app is notorious among students for having hard-to-use design, sometimes preventing people from getting tickets when desired. A high amount of students must contact ticketing services due to failure to request a ticket, or failure for tickets to show up in their account.

This project aimed to re-envision an application in which these processes were more streamlined than the current iteration of the Cockpit app.

## Final result
The final result is hosted on Flutterflow, a low-code solution that has a free student EDU plan. If given more time, I would change some functionalities within the app, for example, including a Firebase database to store user data. Though this project was solely concerned with front-end design, so I am satisfied with the end result.

## Research & Data Collection
I performed two methods of research to collect data justifying the project. Method one involved a survey of 11 respondents. Method included two group interviews asking users about pain points and high points while utilizing the app.

## Low-Fidelity Prototype
Next, a low-fi prototype was created as sketches.

## High-Fidelity Protoype
I then created a hi-fi prototype using Figma to use as a blueprint for development in Flutterflow.

This prototype incorporated feedback from peer review for the low-fi prototype, seen below.

## Reflection
This project was a tremendous success for me as a start-to-finish designer. I took a lot of pleasure in creating a user-friendly and mobile-forward design as a case study for improving the Cockpit app in its current form. Things I would change for next time include looking at creating a web abb for front end, utilizing Firebase functionality in using Flutterflow, and implementing user testing in addition to surveying.
