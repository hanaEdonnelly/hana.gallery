<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>In this role, I worked alongside Professor Dezhi Wu at the University of South Carolina and 2 other students to design and implement a chatbot to assist in theraputic conversation for children with autism.</p>

<h2 id="work-to-date">Work to date</h2>
<p>As of March 2024, this project is still a work in progress.</p>

<p>Our team conducted a literature review in January and February to determine the possibilities for this application. Through this, we determined that there is existing evidence that a chatbot could be implemented to assist in children with autism in improving communication and helping with social anxiety.</p>

<p>Our project aims to focus on the areas of fun, social skills training (SST), and helping with emotional regulation.</p>

<p>To accomplish this, we used Googleâ€™s chatbot service DialogFlow to set up use cases in a professional manner. This software was chosen due to its inclusion in studies within the literature review, as well as offering a low-cost solution for this study.</p>

<p>This page will be updated soon upon project completion.</p>
