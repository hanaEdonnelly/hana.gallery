<p>In ITEC444, we were instructed to create a mobile app design for our course-long project.</p>

<p>I chose to re-design the “Cockpit” app, a proprietary app at USC for students and faculty to access free football tickets.</p>

<p>The app is notorious among students for having hard-to-use design, sometimes preventing people from getting tickets when desired. A high amount of students must contact ticketing services due to failure to request a ticket, or failure for tickets to show up in their account.</p>

<p>This project aimed to re-envision an application in which these processes were more streamlined than the current iteration of the Cockpit app.</p>

<h2 id="final-result">Final result</h2>
<p>The final result is hosted on Flutterflow, a low-code solution that has a free student EDU plan. If given more time, I would change some functionalities within the app, for example, including a Firebase database to store user data. Though this project was solely concerned with front-end design, so I am satisfied with the end result.</p>

<h2 id="research--data-collection">Research &amp; Data Collection</h2>
<p>I performed two methods of research to collect data justifying the project. Method one involved a survey of 11 respondents. Method included two group interviews asking users about pain points and high points while utilizing the app.</p>

<p>Next, a low-fi prototype was created as sketches.</p>

<p>I then created a hi-fi prototype using Figma to use as a blueprint for development in Flutterflow.</p>

<p>This prototype incorporated feedback from peer review for the low-fi prototype, seen below.</p>

<h2 id="reflection">Reflection</h2>
<p>This project was a tremendous success for me as a start-to-finish designer. I took a lot of pleasure in creating a user-friendly and mobile-forward design as a case study for improving the Cockpit app in its current form. Things I would change for next time include looking at creating a web abb for front end, utilizing Firebase functionality in using Flutterflow, and implementing user testing in addition to surveying.</p>
